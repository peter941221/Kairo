# Baseline runtime status

Last verified in WSL Ubuntu 24.04 on the local RTX 5090:

| Component | State | Version / detail |
|---|---|---|
| GPU | usable | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, 32,607 MiB |
| Driver | usable | 596.36 |
| CUDA compiler | usable for native probe | CUDA 13.0 (`/usr/local/cuda-13.0/bin/nvcc`) |
| PyTorch | GPU visible | 2.12.0+cu130; `torch.cuda.is_available()=True` |
| TensorRT-LLM | importable | 1.3.0rc25 |
| vLLM | CLI importable | 0.29.0 |
| SGLang | service smoke passed in isolated env | 0.5.19 |

## Service smoke gate (Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct)

- **vLLM 0.29.0: passed** on the RTX 5090. With CUDA 13.0 selected and
  `VLLM_WSL2_ENABLE_PIN_MEMORY=1`, the server reached `/health` and returned
  the exact deterministic response `KAIRO_OK` from `/v1/chat/completions`.
- **SGLang 0.5.19: passed in an isolated environment.** The server reached
  `/health` and returned `KAIRO_OK` from `/v1/chat/completions` using
  `/home/peter/venv-sglang` (PyTorch 2.13.0+cu130 and
  `sglang-kernel==0.4.6.post1`).
- The original shared environment remains unsuitable for SGLang: its
  `sgl_kernel` SM120 object was built against a different PyTorch C++ ABI
  (`undefined symbol: c10::ValueError...`). Keep it reserved for TensorRT-LLM
  and the already-validated vLLM lane.

## Important qualification

vLLM and SGLang were installed into the existing `/home/peter/venv-gpu`
environment without dependency resolution so that the TensorRT CUDA 13 stack
would not be replaced. Their package metadata requests a newer/different set of
versions (notably torch 2.13.0 and framework-specific CUDA wheels). Therefore:

- the service smoke result is valid only for the explicitly recorded backend
  environment and launch flags;
- no throughput or latency claim is valid yet;
- the next gate is a pinned decode/prefill baseline with repeated samples;
- if either backend fails, create a dedicated pinned environment instead of
  mutating `venv-gpu` further.

The smoke harness accepts `KAIRO_VLLM_BIN` and `KAIRO_SGLANG_PYTHON`, so an
isolated backend environment can be tested without changing the TensorRT
environment.

The old Moonmath records remain useful historical evidence: vLLM 0.26.0 and
SGLang 0.5.17 were previously run on this same 5090, with WSL-specific pin-memory
and CUDA Graph settings.
